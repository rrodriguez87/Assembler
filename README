2-PASS ASSEMBLER
Created by Rodrigo Rodriguez

Writtin in C++, this 2-pass assembler converts SIC (Simulated Instructional Computer) instructions to their machine code equivalent.  Output is an object file that ready to be loaded into system memory. To initiate assembler functions, a command line interface was created. 


NOTE: Not all commands in the CLI have been implemented. Commands that are still being worked one will display the name of the function that was called.
